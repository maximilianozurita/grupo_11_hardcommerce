### v6 Release

You can find the detailed changelog [here](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/blob/main/docs/manual/other-topics/upgrade-to-v6.md).

## Note: Looking for maintainers!

Recently, a bigger part of the former core maintainers (thanks to all your hard work!) have been rather busy. Hence, the available time to look after our beloved ORM has been shrinking and shrinking drastically, generating a great chance for you:

We are looking for more core maintainers who are interested in improving/fixing our TypeScript typings, improving the documentation, organizing issues, reviewing PRs, streamlining the overall code base and planning the future roadmap.

If that sounds interesting to you, please reach out to us on [our Slack channel](https://sequelize.slack.com/) by sending a direct message to *Pedro A P B*. If you don't have access, get yourself an invite automatically via [this link](http://sequelize-slack.herokuapp.com/). We are looking forward to meet you!
